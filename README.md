# EventTicketsWithUber

# Final Assignment
We will use the results of this assignment for a formal and final evaluation and as such you should write the code individually. Plagiarism is a violation of the Academy contract and makes nobody happy.

###Intro
We all want to be millionaires, right? This is your chance to join the 3 Comma Club with this amazing business idea: Uber for tickets.

It doesn't exist yet and will make us millions, we just have to build it right now!

"Greed is good" - Gordon Gekko

We want customers to offer tickets to events in Amsterdam and when you buy them, we automatically dispatch a car to pick you up to the event.

## Description
The app should have a login and signup page for customers. You need to login to create events, tickets and comments.

Events have:

a name
a description
a picture or logo
a start and end date (could be the same)
After you click on an event, you see a list of tickets that are offered for this event.

A ticket is made for a specific event and has an author (the user that created the ticket). Apart from that, it has:

a picture of the ticket (optional field)
a price
a description
When you click on a ticket, you see the details of that ticket (description/price) and which event it's for. On this page you can add comments as a customer, and everybody can see all the comments.

A comment has a text and is connected to a specific ticket. It also has an author.

Anybody can view events and tickets, but you have to login to add a new ticket or comment.

##!! Fraud risk algorithm !!
This is an important part of the assignment. If you only finish one thing, it should be this thing!

Tickets can be fraudulent, and as a customer I don't want to buy a fake ticket! Because of that we want to show to customers the risk that they are taking when buying the ticket.

On the ticket page for a specific ticket, we want to show a text like:

"We calculated that the risk of this ticket being a fraud is XX%"

The percentage should be calculated using the following algorithm:

if the ticket is the only ticket of the author, add 10%
if the ticket price is lower than the average ticket price for that event, that's a risk
if a ticket is X% cheaper than the average price, add X% to the risk
if a ticket is X% more expensive than the average price, deduct X% from the risk, with a maximum of 10% deduction
if the ticket was added during business hours (9-17), deduct 10% from the risk, if not, add 10% to the risk
if there are >3 comments on the ticket, add 5% to the risk
The minimal risk is 5% (there's no such thing as no risk) and the maximum risk is 95%.

## User stories

As a logged in customer I want to be able to create events with a name, picture (logo), date and description
As a customer I can see some color (red/yellow/green) indicating the fraud risk of a ticket for all tickets in the all tickets list
##Bonus stories

Use the Uber API to dispatch an Uber when you buy a ticket
##Tools and technology
We recommend to use starter kits that we provided during the program to start this app.

In terms of backend (server) technology, you can work with any NodeJS backend: JavaScript or Typescript, Express, Koa or routing-controllers is up to you. The API should be following the better part of the REST principles.

For the frontend, we expect you to properly use React and Redux. Make sure you use the Redux store to your advantage! Use either create-react-app or one of the starter kits that you've used before.

Feel free to add any packages that you like. E.g. MaterialUI can be used to set up a nice layout (maybe even responsive!) but there are perfect alternatives as well.
